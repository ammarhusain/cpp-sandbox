# cpp-sandbox
Sandbox to test out various c++ tricks &amp; techniques.

Current examples:

1. (`compile-failure-tests`) Tests (for the CTest dashboard) that are expected to fail at compile time.

2. (`static-loop-unrollers`) Implementation of a "for loop" that gets unrolled and partially evaluated at compile time. It is similar to the "for_each" in Boost MPL.
